%% Introduction
%
% Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones enables you to
% create and run Simulink models on Parrot Rolling Spider and 
% <matlab:web('https://www.parrot.com/global/minidrones/parrot-mambo-mission','-browser') Parrot Mambo> minidrones. 
% The support package lets you design and simulate estimation and control algorithms for a minidrone in MATLAB and Simulink, and auto-generates 
% embedded c-code that you can use to actually fly the minidrone. After the flight, recorded data can be visualized and analyzed.
% 
% In this example, you will learn how to configure a simple Simulink model
% to generate code for a Parrot Rolling Spider and Parrot Mambo minidrone and run the generated code
% on the board. Using this example, you will spin the propellers connected to motors 1 and 3 for 2 seconds,
% and then spin the motors connected to motors 2 and 4 for 2 seconds, and so on till 20 seconds.


%% Prerequisites
%
% * If you are new to Simulink, we recommend completing the  
% <matlab:web('https://www.mathworks.com/academia/student_center/tutorials/slregister.html','-browser')
% Interactive Simulink Tutorial>.

%% Required Hardware
%
% To run this example you will need the following hardware:
% 
% * Parrot Rolling Spider Or Parrot Mambo minidrone with fully charged battery and
% propellers.
% * Micro USB type-B cable
% * Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 support
 
%% Task 1 - Connect a Parrot minidrone to host machine
%
% In this task, you will connect a Parrot Rolling Spider/Parrot Mambo minidrone to host machine.
%
% *1.* Check if the Parrot minidrone is connected via Bluetooth to the
% host machine by pinging the drone. To check whether Parrot Rolling Spider is connected or not, use the below command for ping. 
% 
% _ping 192.168.3.5_
%
% To check whether Parrot Mambo is connected or not, use the below command for ping. 
% 
% _ping 192.168.3.1_
%
% If the ping is successful, continue to Task 2.
%
% *2.* On the MATLAB Home tab, click *Add-Ons* -> *Manage Add-Ons*.
%
% *3.* Click the gear button as shown in the below figure.
%
% <<../parrot_addon.png>>
%
% <<../variable_input.png>>
%
% *4.* Follow the instructions on
% the screen that appears, and ensure that the Rolling Spider/Mambo minidrone is connected via
% Bluetooth with the host machine. You can refer to the <matlab:helpview(fullfile(codertarget.internal.parrot.getDocRoot,'setup-and-configuration.html'),'-helpbrowser') Setup and Configuration>
% document if you face any issues while connecting the drone to the host
% machine.
%
%% Task 2 -  Model the algorithm to spin the propellers
%
% This task shows how to use the input and output ports to model an algorithm to spin the motors.
%
% *1.* Open the <matlab:open_system('parrot_gettingstarted') Getting started with Parrot minidrone> model.
%
open_system('parrot_gettingstarted');
%%
%
% *2.* Notice the following points in the model:
%
% * There are 2 input ports in the model. The *AC cmd* input port gives a bus signal which
% mainly consists of 'position reference' and 'orientation reference' values
% along with other signals.
%
% * The *Sensors* input port contains data from sensors like accelerometer,
% gyroscope, ultrasonic, pressure, magnetometer and optical flow data.
%
% <<../parrot_inport.png>>
%
% * There are two output ports in the model. The *Motors* output port expects a vector of 4 single values. 
% 
% * The *Flag* output port expects a uint8 scalar value. Model an error condition
% and feed the value to the *Flag* output port. A non-zero value 
% for this port indicates an error condition, and stops the drone flight.
% The non-zero value fed to the *Flag* outport is captured in the flight
% log generated after the flight.
%
% <<../parrot_outport.png>>
% 
% *3.* The
% <matlab:load_system('parrot_gettingstarted');hilite_system('parrot_gettingstarted/Flight_Control_System');
% Flight Control System> subsystem models the logic of spinning of motors. Double click and open the <matlab:load_system('parrot_gettingstarted');hilite_system('parrot_gettingstarted/Flight_Control_System');
% Flight Control System> subsystem.
%
% <<../parrot_subsystem.png>>
%
% *4.* The logic used to spin alternate motors for 2 seconds each is
% mentioned below:
%
% * Two *Pulse Generator* source
% blocks with $90^\circ$ phase shift are used to spin alternate motors for 2
% seconds each.
%
% * The input port values are not used in this model and hence are
% terminated by connecting the input port signals to the *Terminator* sink
% block.
%
%
%% Task 3 - Run the generated code on the Parrot minidrone using the Flight Control Interface
%
% This task shows how to spin the motors of the Parrot minidrone
% using the above model.
%
% *1.* In your *parrot_gettingstarted* model, click *Build Model* on 
% the toolbar. The model is loaded to the drone. After the build goes through successfully, 
% a shared object is running on the drone, waiting for a connection from the PC. 
%
% <<../build_model_button.png>>
%
% *2.* If you have selected the *Launch Parrot Flight Control Interface automatically after build* option in the Configuration Parameters dialog box 
% (*Hardware Implementation* pane > *Target Hardware Resources* > *Build Options*), the Parrot Flight Control UI
% opens automatically after the build goes through successfully. 
% It can also be launched by clicking at the link displayed in the Diagnostic Viewer after model build is successful .
%
% <<../parrot_flightControlInterfaceClickLink.png>>
%
% You can also launch the interface by executing  <matlab:Parrot_FlightInterface |Parrot_FlightInterface|> at the *MATLAB* command window.  
%
% <<../parrot_flightControlInterface.png>>
%
% To know more about Parrot Flight Interface go to this <matlab:helpview(fullfile(codertarget.internal.parrot.getDocRoot,'ug','use-flightcontrol-ui-on-parrot-minidrone.html'),'-helpbrowser') section>. 
%
% *3.* Set the power gain of the motors with the help of the slider. The power gain of the motors can be set to a percentage value from 0 to 100. 
% It is recommended to set the power gain to a lower value first to test.
% The default powergain is 10%.
%
% *4.* You can use the Simulation Stop Time for your model as the duration of flight for your minidrone. 
% If you wish to specify your own flight time, clear the checkbox
% and then set the flight time.
% 
% <<../parrot_flightControlInterface_setTime.png>>
%
% *5.* Click *START* . It might take a few minutes after which the motors start spinning.Observe that the two clockwise motors spin for 2s, and then the two counter-clockwise motors spin for 2s, and so on.
% 
% *6.* You can click *STOP* if you wish to stop the motors from spinning before the end of flight time. 
%
% <<../parrot_flightcontrol_new.png>>
% 
% *7.* When the flight time is over or the motors have stopped
% spinning, click *STOP*. Click *Flight Log* to obtain the flight log.
% A text file titled 'droneFlight.txt' is downloaded to your current *MATLAB* directory.
%
% <<../parrot_flightControlInterface_startAgain.png>>
%
% *8.* You can change the power gain and flight time and start the drone
% flight again for the updated values by clicking *START*.
%
% *9.* If you have Simulink Coder License, you can also download the MAT-File for the signals logged in the model.
% Enable MAT-File logging for your model and click *Build Model* to download
% the generated code on the minidrone. 
% Click *START* to spin the motors. After *STOP* is clicked, click *MAT File* to download the MAT-File on your
% current *MATLAB* directory.
% 
%% Task 4 - Use Simulink templates for Parrot Minidrone
% 
% In this Task, you will learn how to use the Simulink templates for Parrot Minidrones. Two templates are provided for the 
% *Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones*, namely, *Code Generation* template and *Flight Simulation* template.
%
% *1.* Open the <matlab:simulink Simulink Start page>.
% 
% *2.* From the *Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones* templates,
% create a new Simulink model using *Code Generation* template.
% 
% <<../parrot_codegen.png>>
%
% The template is categorized into three main regions, namely, input,
% algorithm and output section.
%
% *3.* Use the input ports *Sensors* and *AC cmd*, output ports *Motors*
% and *Flag* as mentioned in Task 2 above.
%
% *4.* Open the 'Flight Control System' subsystem in your new model, and model your own controller
% logic by using the sensor values from the 'SensorBus' and output a $1 \times 4$ vector of single values
% to the *Motors* output port.
% 
% *5.* From the *Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones* templates,
% create a new Simulink project using *Flight Simulation* template.
%
% *6.* Use the new project to design your own controller in the 'Flight
% Control System' subsystem, simulate the 'slQuadcopter' to see your controller in
% action. To build and load the controller that you have designed on to the
% drone, click the *Generate Flight Code* shortcut in the Project Shortcuts
% tab.
%
%% Other Things to try with Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones
% 
% For Example:
%
% *1.* Create and run a model that spins the motors 1 and 2, when the drone is
% tilted in forward direction, and spins the motors 3 and 4, when the drone
% is tilted in backward direction. _Hint:_ Use the accelerometer data from
% the input port *Sensors* to determine the tilt angle.
%
% *2.* Create and run a model that has the following characteristics.
%
% * Spin all the 4 motors
%
% * Model the logic in such a way that the model stops executing after
% 10 seconds. _Hint:_ Use the 'live_time_ticks' signal from the
% *AC cmd* to keep track of time.
%
% * Stop running the model if the drone is tilted by more than  $60^{\circ}$ in any direction. _Hint:_ Use the accelerometer data from
% the input port *Sensors* to determine the tilt angle.
%
% *3.* Fly the drone using the Simulink template as mentioned in this <matlab:helpview(fullfile(codertarget.internal.parrot.getDocRoot,'ug','fly-a-parrot-minidrone-using-the-hover-simulink-model.html'),'-helpbrowser') section>.
%
% *4.* Create a new project using the *Flight Simulation Template* from the Parrot template library,
% which is on similar lines as of the above <matlab:helpview(fullfile(codertarget.internal.parrot.getDocRoot,'ug','use-codegen-template-on-parrot-minidrone.html'),'-helpbrowser') demo>.
% Create your own controller in the framework provided in the newly created
% project, simulate and fly the drone.
