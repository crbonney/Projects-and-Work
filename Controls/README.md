# Controls

This folder contains projects and assignments from the various controls classes I've taken, and some work I've done independently. The table below provides a brief description of each subfolder:

1. Controller Design: This folder contains design and analysis tools I wrote to build linear controllers using common controller form, and analyze them in both time and frequency domain. The types of controllers I have implemented are LQR, RSLQR, SCP RSLQR and PID.

2. Robotics: This folder combines the work from two robotics classes where I developed two types of controllers for. The first is a linear controller to balance an inverted pendulum arm; the second is a nonlinear partitioned controller to cancel the system dynamics, with a linear PD controller to drive to a setpoint.  

3. Quadcopter Flight Controller: This folder contains work from an Systems application lab where I derived the dynamics of the quadcopter, created a nonlinear physical simulation, and then created a linear controller to hover it. Unfortunately, since this class was during Spring 2020 and went remote halfway through the semester, I was only able to simulate the results of the controller, not demonstrate it on the real thing.
