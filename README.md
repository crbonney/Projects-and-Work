# Projects and Work

This repository shows many of the work and projects I completed in school, as well as some personal projects. The majority of my work is in Python or MATLAB, but I have a few projects in Arduino or Node JS.

The first folders listed contain a majority of my academic and professional work, and the later folders are smaller, or personal projects.

1. Controls (MATLAB): Work that I completed for the various Systems Engineering and Control Theory classes, as well as code I wrote to design the controllers. Includes work on Robotic arms with linear and partitioned controllers, Quadcopter system identification and flight controller design, and demos of different types of linear controller design.
2. Computer Vision (Python): Work from a computer vision class. It contains implementations of some common CV and image processing algorithms I wrote from scratch, as well as some of the mathematical background in the homework assignments.
3. Other: A few personal projects ands minor scripts.  
  - Electronics (MATLAB): A couple short scripts I wrote to help with analysis of electronic circuits for a lab.
  - Discord Bots (Node JS): Examples of chatbots I wrote for Discord servers that play music, perform admin duties and more.
  - Arduino (Arduino C++): A couple of smaller non-controls related projects I made using Arduinos.
