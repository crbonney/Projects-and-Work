# Computer Vision

This folder shows the work I completed for a Computer Vision class. The code is written in Python and contains implementations I wrote of common CV algorithms.

For a summary of each assignment, view the "solution.pdf" (or "report.pdf" for the project), which describes the work and mathematical process and shows the output images. Go to the "code" subfolders to see the input and output files as well as the code.
